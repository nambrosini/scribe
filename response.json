Here's a template you can use for writing effective commit messages:\n\n```\n<type>: <short summary>\n\n<detailed description>\n\n<issue reference>\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **<type>**: A short tag that describes the type of change. Common types include:\n   - `feat`: A new feature.\n   - `fix`: A bug fix.\n   - `docs`: Documentation changes.\n   - `style`: Code style changes (formatting, indentation).\n   - `refactor`: Code refactoring (no functional changes, no fixes).\n   - `perf`: Performance improvements.\n   - `test`: Adding or fixing tests.\n   - `chore`: Build process or auxiliary tool changes.\n\n2. **<short summary>**: A brief description of the change (50 characters or less).\n\n3. **<detailed description>**: (Optional) A more detailed explanation of the change, including the motivation for the change and the context. This can be multiple lines.\n\n4. **<issue reference>**: (Optional) A reference to the related issue or ticket, if applicable.\n\n### Example:\n\n```\nfeat: add user authentication\n\nImplemented user authentication using JWT. This includes login, logout, and token verification.\n\n#345\n```\n\n### Tips:\n\n- Use the imperative mood for the short summary (e.g., \"fix bug\" instead of \"fixed bug\" or \"fixes bug\").\n- Keep the short summary concise and to the point.\n- Provide enough detail in the description to explain the context and the reason for the change.\n- Reference any related issues or tickets to maintain traceability.\n\nBy following this template, you can ensure that your commit messages are clear and helpful to anyone reviewing the project history."
